These files were created with Max/MSP version 8.5.6, or RNBO 1.2.3. Links on how to use and/or install below. 

This is a basic patch/external/plugin/device that allows the user to adjust a the volume of a stereo signal. The decibel range is from -72 dB to +35 dB.
-72 dB is converted to negative infinity dB.
Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.
